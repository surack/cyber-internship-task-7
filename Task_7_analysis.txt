Task: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

Date: 14 August 2025

Step 1: I opened Google Chrome and accessed the Extensions manager via More Tools > Extensions. All installed extensions were displayed.

Step 2: I carefully reviewed each extension, reading its name and description.

Step 3: For every extension, I clicked "Details" to review the permissions it required. I also searched for the extension names online to check for reviews or red flags.

Step 4: I identified "Free PDF Converter" as unused and noticed it requested permission to access all my website data, which is suspicious. Another extension, "Quick Coupons", had no reviews and seemed redundant.

Step 5: I removed both "Free PDF Converter" and "Quick Coupons" by clicking the Remove button and confirming.

Step 6: I restarted Chrome and noticed pages loaded a little faster.

Step 7: Research revealed that malicious extensions can steal passwords, inject ads, or track browsing. Excessive permissions and a lack of reviews are common warning signs.

Why I did this:
- To clean up my browsing experience and protect my personal data.
- To learn how malicious extensions operate and how to spot them.

Observations:
- Many extensions ask for more permissions than they need.
- Some extensions were installed automatically by other applications.
- After cleanup, Chrome performance improved.
- Regular reviews help keep browser secure and efficient.

Extensions Removed:
- Free PDF Converter (unused, suspicious permissions)
- Quick Coupons (no reviews, unnecessary)

Overall, this task taught me the importance of regularly auditing browser extensions and checking for security risks.
